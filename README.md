# README

This is my first Ruby on Rails application!

Thanks to GoRails.com -- great tutorial.  I was able to work through that tutorial,
and then decided to create a Ruby on Rails app to rewrite my 
Promineo Tech BESD Coding Bootcamp Final Project.

Using the gorails.com template, I was able to create a simple interface in my browser.
